# macblame
==========
A better git blame to use in your Terminal.app
This tool is used along with git to get a better version of "git blame <filename>".. It will give you the percentage of contribution by individual users, so that it will be easier for you to blame the right person.. ;)
This idea was conceived by Vignesh Jeyavel of Freshdesk and it's a cool idea!
Quick Install:
```
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/praserocking/macblame/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude='README.md' && ./install.sh
```
Usage:
```
macblame <file1> <file2> .....
```
Enjoy!
