# macblame
==========
A better git blame for use at your mac terminals...
This tool is used along with git to get a better version of "git blame <filename>".. It will give you the percentage of contribution by individual users, so that it will be easier for you to blame the right person.. ;)
This Idea was concieved by Vignesh Jeyavel of freshdesk and its a cool idea!
Usage:
                ./install.sh
to install macblame on your terminal and 
                macblame <file1> <file2> .....
to use it!

Limitations:
============
* tested with git 2.2.1 so I cant guarantee you good results on lesser versions.
* needs Ruby on your terminal!
